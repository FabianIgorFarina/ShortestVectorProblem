# Shortest Vector Problem and its quantum algorithm

Here I put a few files that make it easier to tackle the shortest vector problem. The idea of formulating it in a way that is computable by a quantum annealing process is based on the work of D. Joseph et al. and their paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14057.
